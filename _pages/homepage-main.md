<p>This is my personal website, I upload here my projects. The project I'm working on is a robot, witch has a lidar on it and calculates the x and y cordinates, and makes a map. ETA: July 2019. I love electronics and computers. Click on the "My projects" link on the top navigation plane to see my projects. I have used HTML5, CSS3, php and python3 for my various tasks. I use c++ now almost about 1 year. I very like programming. A finish a project in about a year. (I do very complicated projects and I'm doing it myself.)</p>
