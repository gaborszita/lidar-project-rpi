<p>I have faced many problems in the SLAM algorithm based on the lidar readings, so I'm putting a mouse on the robot and use that mouse for optical tracking. The software code is already completed, it's the <a href="https://github.com/gaborszita/lidar-project-rpi">github</a> of the project. So if you want to check it out, just head over there. I will assemble the mouse on the robot this weekend. I will post the updates here in the news section.</p>
